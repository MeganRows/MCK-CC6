The night is dark and full of terror
My mind was spooked in horror
Your past keeps on hunting me
and curiosity is killing me
In this moment where it is beyond bedtime
Got stuck in a never ending thoughts of mine
Wanting to uncover the secrets you've made
To learn the truth but I'm still afraid
My peace of mind will never last
since it wants to see the unseen from your past.
