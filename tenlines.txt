how dark and yet not empty a night is 
swallowed by vastness, and lighted up by the moon's kissed
running round lick a cat trick by his own tail
endless chasing dream of tale
how desperate one can be
for the desire he urge, have urge to flee
after endless walk through the darkness 
the darkness seems to end
unknowing what will it bring and leave
yet knowing inner peace will never be achieved
